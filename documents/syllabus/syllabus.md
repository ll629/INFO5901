## Overview

In this course (INFO 5901) students will receive guidance toward working on their
MPS project (INFO 5900).

Class will consist of two primary activities:

1.  *Project work*: This course is adjacent to working on your INFO 5900
    MPS project, a semester-long project sponsored by an industry or
    academic client. Students will apply the skills they learn in the
    MPS program to a real-world project that includes requirements,
    project management, deadlines, and deliverables. Substantial class
    time will be dedicated to specific activities related to the team
    project.

1.  *Guest speakers*: lectures and case studies in key professional
    disciplines such as communication, presentations, teamwork, risk
    management, project management and execution. The purpose is to help
    students develop project skills during the semester that will
    benefit them in their future employment.

This course is based on material by Gilly Leshed and Jon Saxe.

## Policies

### Communication

**For all course related communication please email <info5901-prof@cornell.edu>.** Please do not email the course staff (instructor and TAs) directly using their personal emails. You always use the course email for communication with the teaching staff.

As a general rule of thumb, please communicate any issues with the instructor in advance. I'm happy to help in any way that I can or make considerations so long as you communicate in advance. Asking for a consideration after the fact, will likely result in your consideration request being denied.

### Attendance

On-time class attendance is required. Attendance will be taken at the beginning of each class. You are allowed up to **two excused absences**. To use these excused absences, just use them. There is no need to email me or notify the course staff.
This should give you enough flexibility to plan for interviews, religious holidays, unexpected sickness, family emergencies, etc. Any absence beyond two, regardless of the reason, will result in reduction of your grade.

### Laptops and Cell Phones

Please no laptop or cell phone usage during lectures. Especially during guest lectures.

### Late Submission

Unless otherwise announced, all project deliverables are due at the
beginning of the class on the day that they are due. Late assignments will
receive a 0. Under exceptional circumstances points will be deducted at
the discretion of the instructors for late assignments. Exceptional
circumstances will be considered only if discussed with the teaching
staff **in advance**.

### Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is crucial to your personal ethical identity. Your
rights and responsibilities in this area are outlined in the Cornell
University Code of Academic Integrity
<http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/aic.cfm>. Violations of the code of conduct
include but are not limited to:

-   **Implying your project is further along than it actually is in a
    project status report.**
-   Submitting work in this class that has also been submitted for a
    grade in another course without prior permission of both
    instructors.
-   Using, obtaining, or providing unauthorized assistance on papers or
    any other academic work. All outside assistance should be reported,
    and the work of others should be properly referenced.
-   Misrepresenting another person's work as your own. This means
    presenting someone else's words or ideas without proper attribution,
    which is considered *plagiarism*. Proper attribution includes
    quotation marks and page numbers for any words taken directly from
    any piece of another author's work, and/or a citation when you have
    paraphrased or summarized somebody else’s work. Sources need not be
    published to be cited; any document that you use as a source that
    you are not the sole author of must be cited or attributed in this
    way. If you have any questions or concerns about how to attribute or
    whether a source must be cited, please ask for clarification in
    advance. Plagiarism will not be tolerated and will be strictly
    sanctioned. More information is available at
    <http://plagiarism.arts.cornell.edu/>.

You are responsible for obeying the Code of Academic Integrity.
Ignorance of the code is not an excuse. Academic integrity is a serious
matter and will be treated as such.

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

If you need an accommodation for a disability, please provide
your accommodation letter from Student Disability Services. Some aspects
of this course such as guest lectures and project activities and
assignments may be modified to facilitate your participation and
progress. It is Cornell policy to provide reasonable accommodations to
students who have a documented disability (e.g., physical, learning,
psychiatric, vision, hearing, or systemic) that may affect their ability
to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements.

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact Student Disability
Services and the teaching staff for a confidential discussion of their
individual need for academic accommodations. More information about
Student Disability Services can be found at <http://sds.cornell.edu/>.


## Guest Lectures

Frequently throughout the semester, we will invite a professional to
guest lecture about topics related to project management and
professionalism in information science.

Laptop and cell phone usage is prohibited during all guest lectures.

## Project Milestones and Deliverables

In your semester-long project, you will be working in a team for an
industry/academic client, to define the problem, come up with a project
plan, research into the problem space, apply a broad design thinking
perspective to address the problem, and complete milestones and deliver
artifacts and presentations.

Project teams will be assigned at the beginning of the semester based on
a match of the project needs and students’ skills. Each team will have
diverse skill-sets to draw upon. This will be valuable to you as well as
to the companies that are sponsoring the project. It will provide you
with the knowledge and skills required to work on a real-life problem
faced by a company and thus prepare you to excel in your careers.

### Project Selection and Assignment

Before the semester, students will receive a document with descriptions
of the projects offered by industry/academic sponsors. The teaching
staff will then assign students to project teams. We will make an effort
to assign students to one of their top five ranked projects, however,
this might not always be possible.

### Clients

A representative from the industry/academic sponsor will serve as the
project client. You should ensure that the project is progressing to the
satisfaction of the client and that you are fulfilling the goals that
the client sees important for the project.

The team should choose one student who will serve as the contact to the
client. You can rotate this position through the semester, but you
should ensure that there is only one person who is in charge at any time
to keep in touch with the client.

You should schedule to meet with the client (in person if local or via
phone or Skype if remote) every week, for about 30 minutes. It
would be useful to schedule all the meetings at the outset of the
semester. Having an agenda of what you will present and discuss at the
meeting will help you organize and prepare for the meeting. In addition,
plan to have a weekly email update to the client to demonstrate
consistent progress on the project.

## Assignments

### Conflict

Conflict is a normal part of any team project. If you have a conflict
within your group that you cannot resolve internally, **you are required
to bring the conflict to the attention of the teaching staff
immediately**. Prolonged team conflict will result in a grade reduction.

### Weekly Logs

Each student will keep a weekly log of progress in which you will note
what you did, what you learned, and how your team is doing this week. At
the end of each week, each student will submit a short summary of this
log. The purpose of these weekly logs is to ensure steady progress and
accountability of each student and the team as a whole.

Your weekly log is what you personally worked on for the week. You should not include what your team worked on. Each weekly log should be no more than a page. You do not need to write blocks of text. Bullets points are 100% acceptable and encouraged.

### Milestones and Deliverables

The details below outline project deliverables. Additional details about
the requirements of each assignment will be provided in class and
through Blackboard.

-   **Team Contract:** Before you begin working on your project you will author a team contract. The team contract will set the rules and expectations that you and your team members will follow while working on your project.

-   **Project Plan:** The first deliverable will consist of a document
    in which the team will identify and justify the primary ideas of
    your project, describe the problem you plan to address and the
    methodologies you intend to use, outline the sources, tools, and
    techniques you will use to address the problem, and provide a
    detailed time-line with your activities, work distribution and
    project plan for achieving the project goals.

-   **Progress Report I:** The purpose of this mid-way report is to
    ensure that you are making systematic progress toward completing the
    project successfully. In this report, you will describe what you
    have achieved so far and outline any changes to the project plan
    since you presented the initial plan.

-   **Progress Report II:** In this report you will demonstrate that you
    have achieved considerable progress in the project. As in Progress
    Report I, you will describe any changes to the project plan since
    the last report. Here you will also provide a detailed plan toward
    successful completion.

-   **Final Report:** This document will summarize your team efforts
    over the semester and will serve as an executive summary that you
    hand over to the client. In this document, you will describe the
    problem you worked on, the methods and tools you used, the
    activities you carried out, and the final outcomes you are providing
    to the client. If your project involves the creation of a product,
    you should append to your report a handover package with the
    product.

-   **Final Presentation:** You will prepare and present the results of
    your project to the client. Your presentation should be polished and
    professional. It should also accurately describe the final outcome
    of your project.

-   **Project Showcase:** At the end of the semester, you will present
    with your team what you have worked on during the semester. All
    clients, as well as the information science community: students,
    researchers, and faculty, will be invited to the session. Your
    presentation will be in the form of a poster, around which
    discussions will be held.

### Project Guidance

A member of the teaching staff will check-in with each team frequently and provide the
team with ongoing guidance and feedback. If you need any guidance on your project, please reach out to the teaching staff. We are more than happy to help.

Please note that because the MPS projects cover a wide range of topics,
the teaching staff do not necessary have the specific knowledge required
to help you overcome technical or knowledge-based challenges, should
they occur. In these cases, you are expected to identify the required
sources that can help you overcome the challenges. The teaching staff
will do their best to help you identify these sources.

### Peer Evaluations

At end the end of the semester, students will complete self and peer
evaluation surveys. At the instructor’s discretion, individual grades for the team project may be adjusted based on group members’ evaluation of each other’s quantity and quality of contribution to the group effort. This is in the interest of fairness.

## Grading

I grade to a scale, not to a curve. Letter grades are assigned by the
*integer-part* of your percentage; the *decimal-part* is not a factor.
For example: 96.01, 96.5, and 96.99 are all A’s. 97.0 is an A+.

<div class="page-break"></div>

| Letter | Percent |
|:------:| -------:|
|   A+   | 97-100% |
|   A    |  93-96% |
|   A-   |  90-92% |
|   B+   |  87-89% |
|   B    |  83-86% |
|   B-   |  80-82% |
|   C+   |  77-79% |
|   C    |  73-76% |
|   C-   |  70-72% |
|   D+   |  67-69% |
|   D    |  63-66% |
|   D-   |  60-62% |
|   F    |   0-59% |

When reporting the progress of your project to the teaching staff, if
you are in anyway deceptive about the status of your project, I reserve
the right to lower your grade. This includes lowering your final grade.

### INFO 5901

Your grade is computed as the following weighted average:

| Assignment             | Percent |
| ---------------------- | ------- |
| In-class Participation | 10%     |
| Assignments            | 10%     |
| Project assignments    | 40%     |

Attendance and Participation: guest lectures, work sessions, weekly logs, peer evaluations, team contract, practice presentation, etc.   20%
Project Assignments: project plan, progress report I & II, final report, presentation, poster, project deliverables, etc.                70%
Final Client Evaluation                                                                                                                  10%
