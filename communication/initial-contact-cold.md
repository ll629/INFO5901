# Cornell Project Partnership

Hi,

I just graduated from Wash U and I now work as a lecturer at Cornell University in the Computing and Information Sciences Department. (http://infosci.cornell.edu/)

One of my responsibilities at Cornell is to provide our Master of Professional Studies (MPS) students with professional experience from a semester long industry partnered project. This arrangement provides real-world experience to the students while producing free deliverables and IP for our partners.

I was writing to ask if you, or your company, might be interested in partnering with us for an MPS project (or several).

A few details about the MPS projects:
1) Company or research partners define a project in a technology/business area that is important to them.
2) Projects typically fall in the intersection of the following areas: data science & data analytics, machine learning, user experience & design, and mobile/web development. Deliverables are often prototypes, source code, evaluations/usability studies, business cases, and research.
3) The project scope is around 300-400 person-hours of work. (2-3 students Ã— 9 hr/week x 15 weeks)
4) We ask that our partners spend roughly 30 minutes a week communicating with the students to make sure the project progressing appropriately.
5) There is no cost for sponsoring a project. However, project partners are responsible for any non-labor related costs associated with the project. Partners must provide any required software, hardware, and datasets before the semester begins. Additionally, if travel is required for the project, the partner is responsible for the cost.
6) While not required, we ask that partners make a visit to Cornell at the end of the semester for final presentations. Alternatively, you may arrange travel to have the students visit your workplace instead.
7) Partners keep the deliverables and IP. A legal structure for the program is already in place; it allows project sponsors to drive NDAs, data confidentiality etc.

Please let me know if you are interested or if you have any questions. Feel free to email or call me at 314-655-8501 for a quick chat. Please note that we have a soft deadline to have the project concept by mid June.

Thanks,
Kyle
