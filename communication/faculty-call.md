Dear IS faculty, researchers, and PhD students,

Spring 2018 semester is around the corner, and our MPS students will be looking for projects to work on as part of their degree requirements. Given a diverse set of backgrounds and interests, projects may involve design, programming, data analytics, user research, machine learning and more. Deliverables are often prototypes, source code, evaluations/usability studies, business cases, and research. The project scope is around 300-400 person-hours of work. (2-3 students Ã— 9 hr/week x 14 weeks)
We ask that our partners spend roughly 30 minutes a week communicating with the students to make sure the project progresses appropriately. Project partners are responsible for any non-labor related costs associated with the project. Partners must provide any required software, hardware, and datasets before the semester begins.

If you would like to serve as a partner for an MPS project during Fall 2017 semester, please fill out the attached project proposal form and send it back to Kyle Harms (kyle.harms@cornell.edu) by August 11th. We will compile all the projects together and send them to students on August 16th.

A few points to note:
- This will be a team project (about 3 students per team). If you want to work with an individual student, they should use INFO 4900 and this will not count toward their MPS project requirement but instead as elective credits.
- Students will be bidding on projects August 16-24, after which we will assign them to project teams. You will have a chance to review the students assigned to your project before the final assignment, but you will need to do this in a tight time window of August 25-27. The condensed schedule is in the interest of allowing students to start working on their projects on Monday August 28th.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
Kyle
