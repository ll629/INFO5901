# Call for Spring 2018 MPS Projects

Dear IS faculty, researchers, and PhD students,

Spring 2018 semester is around the corner, and our MPS students will be looking for projects to work on as part of their degree requirements.

- Given a diverse set of backgrounds and interests, projects may involve design, programming, data analytics, user research, machine learning and more.
- Deliverables are often prototypes, source code, evaluations/usability studies, business cases, and research.
- The project scope is around 400-500 person-hours of work. (3-4 students × 9 hr/week × 14 weeks)
- We ask that our partners spend roughly 30 minutes a week communicating with the students to make sure the project progresses appropriately.
- Project partners are responsible for any non-labor related costs associated with the project. Partners must provide any required software, hardware, and datasets before the semester begins.
- This will be a team project (about 3-4 students per team). If you want to work with an individual student, they should use INFO 4900 and this will not count toward their MPS project requirement but instead as elective credits.

If you would like to sponsor an MPS project for the Spring 2018 semester, please **send an email to is-mps-projects@cornell.edu** expressing your interest. I'll follow-up with you and I'll also pass along the project proposal form which needs to be **completed by December 11th**.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Kyle Harms
