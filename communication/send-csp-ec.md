I've also attached the agreement that we use to protect your IP (it's like an NDA). In order to sponsor this project we'll need to have this form signed and returned to me by 1/15/2018. The students will sign the agreement on the first day of class (1/29/2017). Please feel free to reach out to me if there are any concerns about the agreement.
