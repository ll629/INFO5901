# MPS Project Interest - Spring 2018


Hello MPS Students (& future MPS students),

I'm in the process of contacting clients to put together the spring MPS projects.

If you are planning on working on an MPS project in the Spring 2018 semester, please complete this survey by 11/14: https://goo.gl/forms/8nKjd8CE2s1dHDtF2

I will use the survey's results to ensure that all interested students will have a project for spring that is related to their interests.

Thanks,
Kyle Harms
