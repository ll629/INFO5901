# Subject: Cornell Project Partnership - Spring 2018


__Name__,

The Information Science Department at Cornell University provides our Master of Professional Studies (MPS) students with a professional experience from a semester-long industry partnered project. This arrangement provides real-world experience to the students while producing free deliverables and IP for our partners.

I am writing to ask if you, or your company, might be interested in partnering with Cornell to sponsor an MPS project (or several) for the upcoming Spring 2018 semester.


A few details about the MPS projects:

1) Company or research partners define a project in a technology/business area that is important to them.

2) Projects typically fall in the following areas: data science & data analytics, machine learning, user experience & design, and mobile/web development. We are particularly interested in data science and machine learning related projects. See http://infosci.cornell.edu/academics/mps/mps-projects/sample-mps-projects for examples of past MPS projects.

3) Our MPS students possess a diverse set of skills, backgrounds, and interests. In fact, many of them are international students. We carefully select student teams with complementary experiences in order to help them succeed on challenging and interdisciplinary projects.

4) Projects that are entirely programming, development, or software engineering are NOT well suited to Information Science students. If your project is mostly development-based we are happy to put you in touch with a similar program for Computer Science students.

5) There is no cost for sponsoring a project. However, project partners are responsible for any non-labor related costs associated with the project. Partners must provide any required software, hardware, and datasets before the semester begins (January 2018).

6) Projects are completed by students on the Cornell campus. Students are expected to interact with remote client representatives via email, phone, and videoconferencing throughout the duration of the project. If travel is required for the project (either by the client or by the students), the partner is responsible for the cost.

7) The project scope is around 400-500 person-hours of work (3-4 students × 9 hr/week × 14 weeks).

8) We ask that our partners spend roughly 30 minutes a week communicating with the students to make sure the project is progressing appropriately.

9) Partners keep the deliverables and IP. A legal structure for the program is already in place; it allows project sponsors to drive data confidentiality, etc.

10) We can provide additional security measures to safe-guard your IP/data. This includes setting up a private network, virtual machines, or private git repositories, etc.

11) Remote projects are welcome. In fact, most of our current partners work with our student teams via phone, email, and video conferencing.

12) While not required, we ask that partners make a visit to Cornell at the end of the semester for final presentations. Alternatively, you may arrange travel to have the students visit your workplace instead.

13) Project partners need to complete a project proposal form by December 11th, 2017 (soft-deadline) to participate in the Spring 2018 semester projects.


Please let me know if you are interested partnering with us or if you have any questions.

Thanks,
