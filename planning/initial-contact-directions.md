# Spring 2018 MPS Project - First Steps

Gilly, Jon,

It looks like we have all of the pieces to begin contacting potential clients for spring MPS projects.

We'll probably have around 45-50 students in the spring, which means we'll want about 12-16 projects.

Please contact those potential client from the projects spreadsheet that are listed with you as the "initial contact". For the initial contact, please use your email address and cc is-mps-projects@cornell.edu

Please update the spreadsheet for all communication: "Our Communication Status" & "Client Communciation Status". I usually just write where we are in the process. For example, "emailed 10/20" & "asking manager"

If they are interested in participating, please introduce them to me and I'll take over from there (i.e. get them the proposal form, NDA, etc.). For all future communication I'll use the is-mps-projects@cornell.edu email so you all can see all the communication moving forward.

If you want to check the is-mps-projects@cornell.edu email, follow these instructions: https://it.cornell.edu/outlook-web/view-resource-account-outlook-web

Let's try to the communication flowing between our potential clients soon so that there will be plenty of time to have the proposal done by our soft-deadline, Dec. 11th.

Is there anything else I forgot?

Kyle
